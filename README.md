## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run Code

### 🔧 Using GCC (Terminal)
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

### 💻 Or an IDE 
Use **VS Code** (recommended) with the **C/C++ Extension Pack** and **MinGW**, or any simple IDE like **Code::Blocks** or **Dev C++**.

- [⬇️ Download `VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
- [⬇️ Setup `C/C++ Extension Pack` & `MinGW`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)

> **Fun fact**: It wasn't always this easy! 😹
